      <h3>Setup</h3>
      The game is for 2 player. The Draw Pile contains 108 cards. Each player
      takes seven cards form the Draw Pile.<br />
      The top card from the Draw Pile will be placed in the Discard Pile, and
      the game begins!<br />

      <hr />

      <h3>Game Play</h3>
      You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action with
      the Discard Pile. For example,
      <br />
      if the Discard Pile has a red card with the number 8 you have to place
      either a red card or a card with an 8 on it.
      <br />
      You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).<br />
      <br />
      If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards
      even though they might have a match,
      <br />
      they must draw a card from the Draw pile.<br />
      <br />
      If a player put a Card on the Discard Pile or take a card from the Draw
      Pile, the game moves on to the next person in turn. <br />
      You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.<br />
      The game continues until a player has two card left. The moment a player
      has just two card they must call “UNO!” to put <br />
      another card on the Discard Pile. If they are not calling “Uno”, that
      player must draw two new cards as a penalty. If a player <br />
      call to early "UNO!", that player must also draw two new cards<br />
      To wining the game the player with only one card must call "UNO!" again.
      <br />

    </div>

    <div class="maincontent_Left">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reverse:</b></li>
        <ul>
          If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise. It can only be played
          on a card that matches by color, or on another Reverse card.
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li><b>Skip:</b></li>
        <ul>
          When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their
          turn. It can only be played on a card that matches by color,
          <br />
          or on another Skip card.
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li><b>Draw Two:</b></li>
        <ul>
          When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up
          two cards and forfeit his/her turn. It can only be played on<br />
          a card that matches by color, or on another Draw Two
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li><b>Wild:</b></li>
        <ul>
          This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card.
          The player has to state which color it will represent
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li><b>Wild - Draw Four:</b></li>
        <ul>
          This acts just like the wild card except that the next player also has
          to draw four cards
        </ul>
      </ul>
